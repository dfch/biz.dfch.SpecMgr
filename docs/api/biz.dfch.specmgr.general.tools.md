# `biz.dfch.specmgr.general.tools`

MCP tool wrappers for general-purpose utilities (mirrors ``adr/tools/``'s shape).

``mdformat`` -- a markdown document formatter that preserves YAML frontmatter
blocks (for ADR/UC files) and formats only the body markdown. ``update`` --
the generic, cross-domain whole-body or line-range replace for the eleven
whole-body document types (``type`` is one of
req/uc/tsk/qa/prb/gol/rsk/dec/sop/feat/vcr; optional read-style body-line
``offset``/``limit`` coordinates -- ``offset`` = 1-based first line,
``limit`` = number of lines, omitted = through end of body, ``0`` = pure
insert, ``offset = N+1`` = the virtual end-of-body append position -- strict
validation, splice-then-validate-whole). ``set_status`` -- the generic,
cross-domain status change for all twelve document types (``type`` is one of
req/uc/tsk/qa/prb/gol/rsk/dec/sop/feat/vcr/adr; ``superseded_by`` is
``adr``-only, composing the status as ``"superseded by {superseded_by}"``).
``delete`` -- the
generic, cross-domain hard-delete for the eleven whole-body document types
(``type`` is one of req/uc/tsk/qa/prb/gol/rsk/dec/sop/feat/vcr; ``adr`` is
not supported), resolving the document by ``id``, taking the domain's own
per-id lock, and removing it from disk (the single ``*.md`` file for the
ten flat domains, the entire ``<base>/<id>/`` folder for ``feat``),
returning the deleted path as a string. ``webfetch`` -- a
bearer-authenticated HTTP GET fetch restricted to a configured base URL.
